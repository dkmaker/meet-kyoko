# Meet Kyoko

I have chosen the name "Kyoko" for my project, inspired by the 2014 film [*Ex Machina*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_(film)). In the movie, Kyoko is a humanoid robot who serves as an assistant, performing various tasks to support her creator, Nathan. 

This parallels my project's goal: to develop an AI assistant that aids developers in managing and executing tasks, ensuring projects stay on track.

Naming my project "meet-kyoko" reflects my desire to create an AI assistant that is efficient, reliable, and supportive, much like the character in the film. By establishing this connection, I underscore my project's focus on AI-driven assistance in software development.

My personal experience with ADD and the challenges of maintaining focus amidst numerous ideas highlight the need for a tool like Kyoko. Traditional project management tools may not effectively address the unique needs of individuals who struggle with attention and organization. Kyoko aims to fill this gap by providing structured guidance, helping to manage tasks and maintain focus, thereby enhancing productivity and facilitating the successful completion of AI development projects.

> In summary, the name "Kyoko" symbolizes the supportive and efficient assistant I aim to create, inspired by the character from *Ex Machina*. My project seeks to provide AI developers, especially those facing challenges similar to mine, with a tailored tool to manage tasks, maintain focus, and achieve their goals.
